# University Project: Development of a medication scheduling and monitoring application

This project focuses on the development of a mobile application designed to schedule and monitor medication intake. Using the Android platform, this comprehensive solution is designed to bring convenience and safety to the lives of people who regularly take medications. A feature of the app is the ability to create multiple profiles for each user, allowing you to monitor the health of multiple patients at the same time. The app takes into account many complex factors, such as the active ingredient in the medication, meal times, and possible interactions, offering an effective tool to ensure medication adherence.

The frontend of the app, built on React Bootstrap, is a website specifically designed for administrators. This tool offers effective options for managing a database of medications, including active ingredients and their interactions with each other. Administrators can customize and update medication data, as well as control drug interactions, thereby ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medication administration for the users of the app.
